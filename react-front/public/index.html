							<h2>About us</h2>
							<p>Based in the United Arab Emirates, PawFect Sitters was formed in November 2018 by a group of four animal-loving friends. They set it up after experiencing problems finding reliable petsitters in the UAE. At PawFect Sitters, we specialize in a variety of in-home professional pet sitting services throughout Dubai and Abu Dhabi. From daytime potty breaks to overnight pet sitting, we keep your pet happy, healthy and most importantly, at home. Our range of pet care services are designed to meet your schedule and budget.  As your partners in pet care, we understand and respect the unique bond between you and your pet.</p>

							<h3>Bethany</h3>
							<p>I highly recommend PawFect Sitters! My two dogs (Laura and Hachi) received a lot of love and care by the sitter while I was away for almost two months. I was even updated with daily pictures of the dogs. PawFect Sitters provide meticulous, honest and affordable pet sitting services. I can't wait to utilize the services again during my next trip!!

							<h3>Rufus</h3>
							<p>I was desperately seeking someone to look after my cat Zoe when I go for long business trips. I did some research and found PawFect Sitters. I was very impressed with the detailed reports and services and now I can always leave with the comforting knowledge that the great team at PawFect Sitters will take care of Zoe, including scratching behind her ears.</p>

							<h3>Seow Mei</h3>
							<p>I’m so thankful to PawFect Sitters. They have always been there for us. I’ve never been able to go on a long vacation before because I have two pet birds at home. But now I can go on vacation knowing that my pet birds are in safe and loving hands. My birds are really getting along with the pet sitters! I can now go on my next vacation without any worries. Thank you PawFect Sitters. You're the best!

							<h3>Pierre</h3>
							<p>PawFect Sitters changed my life! I have two dogs at home that need a lot of care. Before I found this company I was running back and forth between work and home on my lunch breaks but now I can relax knowing that my dogs are in safe hands with PawFect Sitters! They are the best petsitting service I’ve ever tried in Dubai! They have well trained staff, they are always on time and they offer good prices.</p>
