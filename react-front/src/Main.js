							<h2>About us</h2>
							<p>Based in the United Arab Emirates, PawFect Sitters was formed in November 2018 by a group of four animal-loving friends. They set it up after experiencing problems finding reliable petsitters in the UAE. At PawFect Sitters, we specialize in a variety of in-home professional pet sitting services throughout Dubai and Abu Dhabi. From daytime potty breaks to overnight pet sitting, we keep your pet happy, healthy and most importantly, at home. Our range of pet care services are designed to meet your schedule and budget.  As your partners in pet care, we understand and respect the unique bond between you and your pet.</p>
